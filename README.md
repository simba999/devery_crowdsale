## Deployment And Execution

### Deploy BTTS Token Contract

* Use BTTSTokenFactory deployed on Mainnet at address 0x{xxxx}
* Execute `bttsTokenFactory.deployBTTSTokenContract(symbol, name, decimals, initialSupply, mintable, transferable)` where
  * `symbol` = `EVE`
  * `name` = `Devery`
  * `decimals` = `18`
  * `initialSupply` = `0`
  * `mintable` = `true`
  * `transferable` = `false`

<br />

### Deploy Devery Crowdsale Contract

* Deploy `DeveryCrowdsale.DeveryCrowdsale`

<br />

### Link Contracts

* Execute `deveryCrowdsale.setBTTSToken(bttsTokenAddress)`
* Execute `bttsToken.setMinter(deveryCrowdsaleAddress)`

<br />

### Generate Tokens For Presale Accounts

* Execute `deveryCrowdsale.generateTokensForPresaleAccounts([account1, account2, ..., accountn])` so all presale accounts have their tokens generated

<br />

### Contribution Period

* First 12 hours restricted to PICOPS registered addresses and have a maximum cap
* Remaining period does not need accounts to be PICOPS registered, and don't have a maximum cap

<br />

### Finalisation

* Execute `deveryCrowdsale.finalise()`

<br />

### Vesting

The crowdsale contract will automatically deploy a vesting contract. To verify the source on EtherScan, you will have to provide the
additional parameter data of 0x{24 zeros}{crowdsale contract address}.

These vesting entries are non-revocable. For revocable vesting entries, allocate the proportion to a wallet address with 1 day and after 1 day
withdraw the tokens to the wallet address and manually process the token vesting.

There are three functions to allocate the vesting schedule:

* `addEntryInDays(address holder, uint proportion, uint periods)`
* `addEntryInMonths(address holder, uint proportion, uint periods)`
* `addEntryInYears(address holder, uint proportion, uint periods)`

The holder will be able to call the `withdraw()` function to withdraw any vested tokens.
